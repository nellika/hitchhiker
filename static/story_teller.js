 '... Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-­two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet...',
 '... whose ape-­‐descended life forms are ...',
 '... so amazingly primitive ...',
 '... that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.',
 '... This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: ',
 '... most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.',
 '... Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but ...',
 '... most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, ...',
 '... which is odd because on the whole it was not the small green pieces of paper that were ...',
 '... unhappy.',
 '... And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, ...',
 '... and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.',
 '... Many were increasingly of the opinion that they had all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.',
 '... And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.',

 '... and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.',
 '... This time it was right, it would work, ...',
 '... and no one would have to get nailed to anything.',
 '... Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it',
 '... a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever.',
 '... This is not her story.'
